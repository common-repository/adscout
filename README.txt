== External services ==
 Our plugin uses two different domains for our website: adscout.io and scoutefy.com. While the content on both domains is the same, we utilize the domain scoutefy.com to minimize the chances of AdBlockers blocking our scripts, as it doesn't contain the word "ad." This is why we are using scoutefy.com for all integration purposes. This is our own internal service withe seperate domain. The same [terms and conditions](https://scoutefy.com/terms-and-conditions) and [privacy policy](https://scoutefy.com/privacy-policy) apply.
